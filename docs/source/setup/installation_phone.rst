Phone Setup

How to Install
--------------
1. Ensure your phone has an unlocked bootloader and it able to support root. Lineage OS is a good place to start for a custom ROM and they have good installation instruction for each device.

2. Install [Magisk](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/official-magisk-v7-universal-systemless-t3473445) by flashing ([App Installs/ROM Feature Installs via Flashing](https://forum.xda-developers.com/wiki/Flashing_Guide_-_Android)).

3. Install RemoteGPSController (RGC) [here](https://www.github.com/Grennith/Map-A-Droid/blob/master/APKs/RemoteGpsController.apk) located in the `APKs` github folder.

4. Install [Link2SD](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buak.Link2SD&hl=en_GB) and ensure that RemoteGPSController is converted to a System Apps.

5. To help with rubberbanding when teleporting do the following
    *  Disable **background** data of Google Play Services
    *  Check the GMS option within RGC settings
